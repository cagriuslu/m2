- More verbose logging, function names usually don't mean much
- TextList doesn't register clicks on the rightmost side of the line
- Custom UI mechanism is broken. Calling remove_deferred, and then adding a new UI causes the newly added UI to be
  removed instead of just removing the old UI. Instead, implement a ticketing system where once the custom UI is created,
  we return a pointer or iterator that can be used for removal.
- Get rid of all floating point equality comparison, they're meaningless.
- Find all functions that return a reference. They may cause accidental copies.
- Sound doesn't play if object dies
- Redirect command line arguments to m2 terminal
- Override ppm doesn't work for dropped items
- SDL_ComposeCustomBlendMode
- Enable VSync, do something while waiting for VSync
- Dialog with an NPC, character screen, inventory, buy/sell against a seller, character selection
- Synth editor
- UI widgets: horizontal/vertical slider, radio button, tabs
- The capabilities of object should be plug-and-play. You shouldn't implement jumping for both enemy and player for example.
- Add width to pathfinder smoothing algorithm
- Try bgfx
- Add timer widget that executes an action after some time
- SmartPointer may be useless, think about it
- sedit ve bsedit'te, selection aktif iken window resize edilirse selection bozuluyor
- There should be a mechanism to introduce multiple variations for a single sprite type. Then maybe they can be selected to show at random.
  Or the level editor can generate random and save. (Ex. Grass Variations)
- Sync bir UI push'la, sonra ekrani resize et. Sycn UI return ettigi zaman geri donulen UI window dimensionlari adjust edilmemis oluyor
- Butun make_return_action<Void>() larin ustunden gec, obje return edilmesi gerekiyorsa return et.
- In multiplayer more, each ServerUpdate should be self contain, and they could be lost. Right now the first ServerUpdate has significance while creating the game
  This should not be the case. There could be another message that signifies that the game should be started with such and such parameters.
  Then each ServerUpdate can hold the same value.
- Game'e eklenen custom non-blocking UI'lara bir handle donelim, sonra onu delete edebilelim.

Level Editor
- Grid'i kapatinca grid silinmiyor
- Buyuk bir kare secimi yaptim. diagonal eksende sprite'lar vardi, baska yoktu. Bir cell yana kayip paste yapinca ortalik yamuldu.

- Take inspiration from: Elden Ring, Diablo 1-2

- Chaser gets stuck sometimes, either solve properly, or add detection
- Build all game mechanics
- Make THE MOST MINIMAL levels to showcase the engine, do not make an enjoyable game.
- Remove Enemy.proto, have a LUT in memory
