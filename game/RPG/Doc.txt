How weapons work:
- Player has a default weapon, but may pick up a special weapon.
- Special weapon also comes with special bullets.
- Player first checks if there's a special weapon, and uses that. Otherwise, default weapon is used.

- Dash capability is also an card. Dash card uses Dash energy, another card constantly adds Dash energy.
