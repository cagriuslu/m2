TurnBased
=========
TCP is used for turn based multiplayer. Before the level is created, the host creates a ServerThread and a ClientThread.
The guests create one ClientThread each. ServerThread starts listening, and ClientThreads connect to it. After
connection, the clients can signal being ready by sending a ping to the server (NetworkMessage without a payload) and
report their sender_ids. sender_id is a random number. It is used to ensure if the connection drops, and the client
tries to reconnect, the server recognizes the client.

Every time a client is connected or disconnected, the server sends a ServerUpdate to report the players waiting in the
lobby.

After enough clients are connected and all of them have signaled as ready, the host can close the lobby by calling
ServerThread.close_lobby(). After this call, no new clients are accepted. Existing clients can drop and reconnect, as
long as they use the same sender_id. Then, the host initializes a level, and calls ServerThread.server_update(), which
contains all the necessary data for clients to initialize their levels.

In turn based games, the physics world does not exist. The game state is stored in objects with Character, and their
positions. A real life player is represented by an object, who might have child objects on the map.
Groups are not supported. Characters can hold resources and named items. Unnamed items are not supported. Resource
limits are not supported.
